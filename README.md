DFDiagram
=========
An extension for MediaWiki that allows the inclusion of Dwarf Fortress-style diagrams.

**Note:** This extension is still fairly experimental - It shouldn't bring down
your wiki, but it might malfunction. Post any issues you find 
[in the issue tracker](https://github.com/lethosor/DFDiagram/issues) 
(you can also make suggestions in the issue tracker).

This extension has only been tested on MediaWiki 1.20/1.21, but should work on most recent versions.
